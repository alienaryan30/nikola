            ABOUT NIKOLA TESLA
        </h3>
        <p>
            Nikola Tesla, (born July 9/10, 1856, Smiljan, Austrian Empire [now in Croatia]—died January 7, 1943, New
            York, New York, U.S.), Serbian American inventor and engineer who discovered and patented the rotating
            magnetic field, the basis of most alternating-current machinery. He also developed the three-phase system of
            electric power transmission. He immigrated to the United States in 1884 and sold the patent rights to his
            system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors to George Westinghouse. In 1891 he invented
            the Tesla coil, an induction coil widely used in radio technology.<br /><br />

            Tesla was from a family of Serbian origin. His father was an Orthodox priest; his mother was unschooled but
            highly intelligent. As he matured, he displayed remarkable imagination and creativity as well as a poetic
            touch.<br /><br />
            Training for an engineering career, he attended the Technical University at Graz, Austria, and the
            University of Prague. At Graz he first saw the Gramme dynamo, which operated as a generator and, when
            reversed, became an electric motor, and he conceived a way to use alternating current to advantage. Later,
            at Budapest, he visualized the principle of the rotating magnetic field and developed plans for an induction
            motor that would become his first step toward the successful utilization of alternating current. In 1882
            Tesla went to work in Paris for the Continental Edison Company, and, while on assignment to Strassburg in
            1883, he constructed, after work hours, his first induction motor. Tesla sailed for America in 1884,
            arriving in New York with four cents in his pocket, a few of his own poems, and calculations for a flying
            machine. He first found employment with Thomas Edison, but the two inventors were far apart in background
            and methods, and their separation was inevitable.<br /><br />
            In May 1888 George Westinghouse, head of the Westinghouse Electric Company in Pittsburgh, bought the patent
            rights to Tesla’s polyphase system of alternating-current dynamos, transformers, and motors. The transaction
            precipitated a titanic power struggle between Edison’s direct-current systems and the Tesla-Westinghouse
            alternating-current approach, which eventually won out.<br /><br />

            Tesla soon established his own laboratory, where his inventive mind could be given free rein. He
            experimented with shadowgraphs similar to those that later were to be used by Wilhelm Röntgen when he
            discovered X-rays in 1895. Tesla’s countless experiments included work on a carbon button lamp, on the power
            of electrical resonance, and on various types of lighting.<br /><br />

            In order to allay fears of alternating currents, Tesla gave exhibitions in his laboratory in which he lit
            lamps by allowing electricity to flow through his body. He was often invited to lecture at home and abroad.
            The Tesla coil, which he invented in 1891, is widely used today in radio and television sets and other
            electronic equipment. That year also marked the date of Tesla’s U.S. citizenship.
